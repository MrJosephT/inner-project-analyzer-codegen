Integrate functionality to delete set meals, ensuring consistency between both controller and service layers' business logic within the project.
1. Create delete method in controller to handle set meal deletion.
2. Implement corresponding delete method in service layer for consistency.
3. Ensure proper error handling for failed deletion attempts.

Function Header: DishController.java Result delete (@RequestParam List<Long> ids)

Description:
Delete multiple dishes, clear cache, and return success in dish management system.

Reuse Functions or Entities:
- DishService
- RedisTemplate

Parameters:
ids: List of Long values representing the unique identifiers of dishes to be deleted.

Return Value:
Success message indicating the deletion of dishes.
```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/delete", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String delete(@RequestParam List<Long> ids) {
    dishService.deleteDishes(ids);
    redisTemplate.delete("dishesCache");
    return "Dishes deleted successfully";
}
```----------------------------------------
In the existing Java code, the `delete` method is mapped to the endpoint "/delete" using the POST method. It takes a list of Long ids as a request parameter and deletes the dishes with those ids using the `deleteDishes` method from the `dishService`. After deleting the dishes, it also deletes the "dishesCache" key from the Redis cache using the `delete` method of `redisTemplate`.

To supplement this code, you can add exception handling to catch any potential exceptions that may occur during the deletion process. This can be done by adding a try-catch block as shown below:

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/delete", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String delete(@RequestParam List<Long> ids) {
    try {
        dishService.deleteDishes(ids);
        redisTemplate.delete("dishesCache");
        return "Dishes deleted successfully";
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return "An error occurred while deleting dishes: " + e.getMessage();
    }
}
```

By adding this try-catch block, any exceptions thrown during the deletion process will be caught and a message indicating the error will be returned instead of a generic success message. This can help in troubleshooting and identifying issues that may arise during the deletion of dishes.
